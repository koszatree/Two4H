# Two4H

This is project of shop web page build on Java Spring Boot framework with Apache Maven to automate app development.
Project was split on backend and frontend part, both available on my GitHub (https://github.com/koszatree?tab=repositories) named consecutively Two4H (for backend) and Two4H-Frontend-New (for frontend).

***

This applicaton uses Java 17, Spring Boot 3.2.3, Hibernate 6.4.4 and Maven 4.0.
Project was build in REST architecture.

Project started as group work on last year of my Bachelor studies and I decided to continue it's development to improve my programming skills.
Right now it supports features such as: register and login; user management from admin panel (listing, editing), also managing shops and products (listing, creating, editing).
I am currently working on Shop Owner panel, fixes and improvement of Admin's page.
In the future I will implement API for maps to locate shops and enable shopping with delivery.
The project will also use containerization via Docker.
